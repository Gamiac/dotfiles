# dotfiles
Dotfiles for Linux config.
### Programs configured/themed:
i3

compton

polybar

irssi

bash

### Screenshots:
coming sometime before the Amiga release of Daikatana
### Known issues:
i3 will create containers for st and firefox in workspaces 1 and 2 on startup. Sometimes this doesn't work, and st will not go into the containers properly. I don't know why, I don't know how to fix it, and I can't guarantee it will ever be fixed. If you want to stop i3 from attempting to do this, edit .config/i3/config and remove all the lines starting with "exec" at the bottom. 

These files are provided as-is, no guarantees if your computer explodes and destroys half the continental US in a HILARIOUS bit of slapstick comedy, etc. etc.
